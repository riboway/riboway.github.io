	<p>Riboway Therapeutics is a Boston-based RNA therapeutics company. We focus on drugging RNA regulation in the CNS to flexibly control targets by up-regulation, down-regulation, functional activation, or inhibition. Our proprietary LEVERAGER platform decodes RNA regulation information and enables development of smart ASOs to re-direct the fate of RNA, with potentially superior safety. We have multiple programs in CNS and CNS-related diseases currently in preclinical stage. All programs exploit novel, druggable RNA processing mechanisms. </p>
