	<p>Riboway Therapeutics: Decoding RNA to precisely control protein expression/function.</p> 

	<p>We specialize in controlling how proteins are made by targeting RNA. Our smart RNA-targeting technology enables us to upregulate, downregulate, activate, or inhibit target proteins, depending on therapeutic needs. This flexibility is driven by our AI-based platform that decodes RNA regulation to identify druggable angles. So far, we have successfully validated 5 out of 5 targets attempted.</p>
	
	<p>We have assets focusing on neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic diseases, including a first-ever ASO designed to activate a high-value, previously undruggable transcription factor. Our lead program, targeting the genetic cause of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2 (SCA2), is a year to IND upon funding.</p>
